# Sequence-alignment
Computational Sequence Alignment (using Needleman-Wunsch and Smith Waterman Algorithms)


# Step-by-Step Execution:

Open Google Colab

    Visit https://colab.research.google.com

Upload Necessary Files
Upload the following files to your Colab environment: • protein_sequences.csv • BLOSUM62_matrix.csv • sequence_alignment.ipynb

Open the Notebook
Open sequence_alignment.ipynb in Colab.

# Run Each Code Block Sequentially

Step 1: Install required packages (e.g., Biopython, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
Step 2: Load BLOSUM62 matrix and protein sequences
Step 3: Perform alignment using both algorithms
Step 4: Store and export results to CSV
Step 5: Generate similarity heatmaps and substitution matrix visualizations

# Output

Console output will show aligned sequence pairs and scores.
Results will be saved in alignment_results.csv.
Heatmaps will be displayed inline.

# Optional Enhancements

Try adding your own protein sequences to protein_sequences.csv.
Modify gap penalty to see how it affects alignment.
Extend to multiple alignment or evolutionary tree generation.

# Requirements:

Python ≥ 3.6

Packages: biopython, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
